        History of Dr.Norman

        <h2>Early life, education and family</h2>
        <p>Borlaug was the great-grandchild of Norwegian immigrants. Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdatter Rinde, of Feios, a
        small village in Vik kommune, Sogn og Fjordane, Norway, emigrated to Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1854.[citation needed]
        The family eventually moved to the small Norwegian-American community of Saude, near Cresco, Iowa. There they were
        members of Saude Lutheran Church, where Norman was both baptized and confirmed.</p>

          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware. It was planned that he
          would lead research on industrial and agricultural bacteriocides, fungicides, and preservatives. However, following the
          December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor
          regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the United States armed forces. One of his first projects was
          to develop glue that could withstand the warm salt water of the South Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Navy had gained
          control of the island of Guadalcanal, and patrolled the sky and sea by</p>

          <h2>Wheat research in Mexico</h2>
          <p>The Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a joint venture by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican
          Ministry of Agriculture, involved research in genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy, soil
          science, and cereal technology. The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was
          importing a large portion of its grain. Plant pathologist George Harrar recruited and assembled the wheat research team
          in late 1944. The four other members were soil scientist William Colwell; maize breeder Edward Wellhausen; potato
          breeder John Niederhauser; and Norman Borlaug, all from the United States.[22] During the sixteen years Borlaug remained
          with the project, he bred a series of remarkably successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat.</p>
